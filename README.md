## Prerequisites

1. **HashPack Wallet**: Install the HashPack browser extension
2. **Hedera Account**: Create a testnet account with some test HBAR
3. **Pinata Account**: Set up IPFS storage with Pinata

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:
   ```env
   # Hedera Network Configuration
   HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
   HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
   HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY

   # Pinata IPFS Configuration
   VITE_PINATA_JWT=YOUR_PINATA_JWT_TOKEN
   VITE_PINATA_GATEWAY_URL=https://gateway.pinata.cloud

   # HashConnect Configuration
   VITE_HASHCONNECT_APP_NAME=Hedera Gallery
   VITE_HASHCONNECT_APP_DESCRIPTION=Decentralized Media NFT Gallery
   VITE_HASHCONNECT_ICON_URL=https://your-domain.com/icon.png

   # Deployed Contract and Collection IDs (will be set after deployment)
   VITE_NFT_CONTRACT_ID=
   NFT_COLLECTION_ID=
   ```
   
5. **Deploy Smart Contract and Create NFT Collection**:
   Navigate to the `smart_contract_minting` directory and deploy the NFT contract:
   ```bash
   cd smart_contract_minting
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployHgalleryNFT.ts --network hederaTestnet
   ```
   Note the `HgalleryNFT deployed to: 0x...` address from the output. This is your `VITE_NFT_CONTRACT_ID`.
   
   Update your root `.env` file with the deployed contract ID:
   ```env
   VITE_NFT_CONTRACT_ID=0x... (your deployed contract ID)
   ```

   Now, navigate back to the root directory and create the NFT collection:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm run create-collection
   ```
   Note the `Token ID: 0.0....` from the output. This is your `NFT_COLLECTION_ID`.

   Update your root `.env` file with the NFT collection ID:
   ```env
   NFT_COLLECTION_ID=0.0.... (your created token ID)
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
7. Start the frontend in another terminal:

# Token Association Fix Test

## Issue Description
The user reported that when connecting with a different account from another device, the wallet connects successfully but when trying to associate with the token, they get an error asking to connect the wallet first, even though the wallet is already connected.

## Root Cause
The `TokenAssociation` component was trying to access `hashConnectService` directly from the wallet context, but the `WalletContext` doesn't expose `hashConnectService` - it only exposes the `signTransaction` method.

## Fix Applied
1. **Updated TokenAssociation component** (`src/components/wallet/TokenAssociation.tsx`):
   - Changed `const { wallet, isWalletConnected, hashConnectService } = useWallet();` 
   - To: `const { wallet, isWalletConnected, signTransaction } = useWallet();`
   
2. **Updated wallet connection check**:
   - Removed `!hashConnectService` from the condition check
   - Now only checks `!isWalletConnected || !wallet?.accountId`
   
3. **Updated transaction signing**:
   - Changed from `await hashConnectService.signTransaction(associateTx)`
   - To: `await signTransaction(associateTx)`

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User connects wallet successfully âœ…
2. User navigates to token association tab
3. Component correctly detects wallet is connected
4. User can click "Associate Token" button
5. Transaction is signed using the wallet context's `signTransaction` method
6. Token association completes successfully

## Test Steps
1. Connect wallet from a different device/account
2. Navigate to `/mint` page
3. Go to "Token Association" tab
4. Verify wallet connection is detected
5. Click "Associate Token" button
6. Confirm transaction in HashPack
7. Verify success message appears

## Files Modified
- `src/components/wallet/TokenAssociation.tsx` (lines 23, 74, 105)

## Console Log Analysis
The user's console log shows:
- Wallet connects successfully: "hashconnect - Initialized successfully"
- Connection status changes to "Paired"
- This confirms the wallet connection is working

The issue was that the TokenAssociation component couldn't access the signing functionality due to the missing `hashConnectService` reference.
